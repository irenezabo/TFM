This is a github repository for my Master's final thesis, submitted on 14/01/2025.

The goal of this repository is for me to get familiarized with the use of github, and to provide access for my TFM tutor and jury to the main scripts used in my MFT. 

The repository contains 2 folders:

1- GetCDS_ProtSeq_DisDom: Contains the workflow (Snakefile) to compute the disorder rate and functional domains of exons of the proteomes of differents species, as well as the associated config file (yaml) and an example LOG file that the completion of this workflow generates. It also contains a bash script adapted by me and used to sort GTF files: sort_gtf.sh

2- Figure_TFM: Contains the R markdown scripts used to generate the main figures of my thesis (Fig. 2-Fig.16). There is a total of 4 scripts, the name of each of them contains information on the figures generated with it. It also contains a "plots" folder, with all the figures generated with the scrips and a table of information relative to figure 15 (information of the enrichment of LRRFIP in muscle-specific exons in all species where it was detected).
